//Final Project: Kroger Purchase Order "Renderer"

//This project takes a sample, dumbed-down purchase order ANSI X12 EDI 850 transaction using Kroger's published implementation convention
//and "renders" it for mortals to read both in the console and in a text file. This program implements concepts from CIS 1202 in the process:
//Sorting algorithms, character data, structs, enums, classes, exceptions, and templates.
//Note: I did not attempt to implement the entire implementation convention, and I'm sure if I knew more there would be better ways of doing
//things. This is an elementary stab at it.

//Kroger's implementation convention is published at https://edi.kroger.com/EDIPortal/documents/Maps/kroger-modernized-systems/Kroger-Modernized-systems_EDI850.pdf.
//See the readme file on GitHub repository for this project for some EDI basics as they apply to this project.
